  <h3>API Limitations</h3>
  <p>As of May 15th 2019, the API package will be downgraded, causing reduced functionality. This means their will no longer be coverage of the English League 1 and the Scottish Premier League.</p>
  <p>Additionally, the number of calls to the API will be reduced from 30 to 10. Exceeding this limit will result in data errors and the user will have to wait till the requests are refreshed.</p>
  <P>API calls are made as follows:</P>
  <ul>
    <li>1 call when opening the fixtures page and another when changing date</li>
    <li>1 call when opening the leagues page and another when changing league</li>
    <li>4 calls when generating a match prediction or refreshing the page</li>
  </ul>
